### Problem 15: Lattice paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
How many such routes are there through a given `gridSize`?

**Tests:**

1.  `latticePaths(4)` should return a number.
2.  `latticePaths(4)` should return 70.
3.  `latticePaths(9)` should return 48620.
4.  `latticePaths(20)` should return 137846528820.

**Note:** For solving this problem, there should be a formula. I don't see the way of just iterating through it.
