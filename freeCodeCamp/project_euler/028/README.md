# Problem 28: Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction, a 5x5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19  6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13


It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an *n* by *n* spiral formed in the same way?



### Tests

1.  `spiralDiagonals(101)` should return a number.
2.  `spiralDiagonals(101)` should return `692101`.
3.  `spiralDiagonals(303)` should return `18591725`.
4.  `spiralDiagonals(505)` should return `85986601`.
5.  `spiralDiagonals(1001)` should return `669171001`.
