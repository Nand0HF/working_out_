# Problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

The sequence of **triangle numbers** is generated by adding the natural numbers. For example, the 7th triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$.

The first ten terms are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let's list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
* **1**: 1
* **3**: 1, 3
* **6**: 1, 2, 3, 6
* **10**: 1, 2, 5, 10
* **15**: 1, 3, 5, 15
* **21**: 1, 3, 7, 21
* **28**: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

From this list, we can see that **28** is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
